    <h2>About Me/Biography</h2>
    <p>
I'm a third-year transfer student majoring in Computer Science at San 
Francisco State University (SFSU). My passion lies in learning about web 
development and AI development, with a long-term goal of becoming a 
full-stack engineer. I believe that being well-rounded is essential in 
this field, which is why I'm interested in working across the entire 
technology stack. In the future, I aspire to create my own software, apps, 
or add-ons that facilitate everyday tasks for people. Outside of my 
studies, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, playing soccer, and spending time 
with friends. These interests help me maintain a balanced and creative 
perspective that I bring to my work.</p>
