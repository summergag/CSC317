Write a modern CSS stylesheet for the following HTML (which I will paste after the prompt).
The CSS should include:
- A dark color scheme similar to GitHub (#0d1117 background, #58a6ff accent, #c9d1d9 text).
- Typography: Use “Poppins” for headings and “Roboto” for body text.
- Layout: Centered, max width 900px, card-like sections with soft shadows and hover effects.
- Navigation bar: Horizontal, centered links with hover underline.
- Dropdown project sections that reveal extra content on hover.
- Profile image: Circular with border and shadow.
- GitHub and LinkedIn icons styled with hover glow and scaling effects.
- Include a responsive layout for smaller screens.
Then, apply the CSS to my provided HTML. (From Chatgpt)
