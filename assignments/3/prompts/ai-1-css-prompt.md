My passion lies in learning about web development and AI development, with a long-term goal of becoming a full-stack engineer. I believe that being well-rounded is essential in this field, which is why I'm interested in working across the entire technology stack. In the future, I aspire to create my own software, apps, or add-ons that facilitate everyday tasks for people. Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing guitar, hiking, playing soccer, and spending time with friends. These interests help me maintain a balanced and creative perspective that I bring to my work.</p>   </section>   <section id="skills">     <h2>Skills</h2>             <h3>Programming Languages and Other Styles</h3>             <ul>         <li>HTML</li>         <li>Python</li>         <li>Java</li>         <li>C++</li>         <li>CSS (Learning)</li>       </ul>             <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>        <ul>           <li>VSCode</li>           <li>IntelliJ</li>           <li>Clion</li>           <li>Terminal</li>           <li>XCode</li>        </ul>             </section>   <section id="projects">     <h2>Projects</h2>        <ul>            <li class="dropdown">             <h4>Library Manager</h4>            <ul class="dropdown-content">               <li>Source code written in C++</li>               <li>Used CLion</li>               <li>Great Project and was really fun to code as I took a                   great time managing different files and a lot of them                   branched from one another.</li>               <li>Brief Description: Program allowed user to buy, rent,                 and return books they used.
