## Individual Reflections

### Nathan Muniz - Hand-written CSS (Part 1) / AI-1 prompt and css
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]

### Summer Gagliardotto - Hand-written CSS (Part 2) / AI-2 prompt and css
I found this assignment to be very helpful learning how to style your web page. I liked doing one style section at a time to see how it affects the page. I also found this assignment to be very fun and focus on my creative side. The page was still pretty simple, but maybe next time, I can make it even better. The sections I contributted to the hand-written stylesheet were the main, h2, ul, li, .dropdown-content, .dropdown:hover .dropdown-content, and footer. We all did our own ai prompt and I'm not sure why, but I had a lot of trouble getting AI to create the css file that I wanted. It was very unpleasing to look at and preffered the handwritten one we made. I might have prompted it too much to do at once. I kept asking other things after to fix it, but it just kept getting worse...

### Akshith Gojuru - AI-3 Text Prompt CSS
Working on this Portfolio Styling Assignment was a great learning experience for me. I worked with my teammates on combining the best parts of both the AI-generated CSS and hand-written CSS to build a hybrid stylesheet. This helped me understand how to merge different styles while keeping the layout consistent and professional. During this step, I applied many responsive design principles to make sure the website looked good on all screen sizes — mobile, tablet, and desktop.For the Switcher Implementation, we integrated the provided switcher.js file, which allowed users to switch between different CSS themes on the portfolio. Setting up and testing the switcher helped me understand JavaScript integration, cross-browser testing, and how to make different style files work smoothly together. We used GitHub throughout the project for version control and collaboration. Working with my teammates helped me learn how to manage branches, handle merge requests, and review each other’s work. It also improved my communication and teamwork skills. Overall, this project helped me improve both my technical and creative skills. I learned modern CSS techniques, responsive design, and how to effectively use AI tools to assist in coding. It also showed me how important clear prompts, organization, and collaboration are when building a real-world web project. I now feel more confident creating professional websites and using AI as a helpful tool in the design process. I even applied the concepts and techniques from this project to enhance the design and functionality of my own personal project, making it more modern and responsive.

### Papat Thanitkhunkitti - AI-4 Image+Text Prompt CSS 
During my work on this assignment I learned that successful AI prompting for image generation and UI code requires clarity, structure, and awareness of constraints. First, prompts must explicitly describe the visual composition for example image aspect ratio, focal point and color palette. These details guide the model to produce assets that integrate cleanly with a page layout.Working with images taught me to treat them as UI components rather than decorative extras. Specifying how an image should behave such as object-fit, hover transform, aspect-ratio and ensure it degrades gracefully across devices. I also learned the value of separating concerns in prompts: one part for the visual style, one part for CSS behaviors, and one part for accessibility/usability instructions. This leads to code that’s easier to test, reuse, and iterate.The process of using ChatGPT is AI is fastest when given precise examples. Providing a minimal HTML scaffold and naming the CSS variables I expect saved a lot of back-and-forth. When generating icons, requesting SVGs and alt text improved quality and accessibility. In future prompts I will always include sample HTML, desired breakpoints, exact color tokens, and a short “do not do” list to get production-ready results in one go.
