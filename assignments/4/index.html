    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Summer, a junior studying Computer Science at San Francisco State University.
		I transferred from Saddleback Community College and am passionate about web development, 
		always excited to explore new technologies. I also have a growing interest in game development, 
		especially the creative problem-solving and design aspects that go into building interactive experiences.</p>
	<p>Looking ahead, my career goal is to land a secure and rewarding job in the tech industry where 
		I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to meaningful projects. Beyond academics, I enjoy 
		cooking, baking, hiking, and spending time with friends—activities that keep me balanced and 
		inspired outside of coding!</p>
