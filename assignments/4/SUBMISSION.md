### Brief description of implementation: 
I built this calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout and design were created with CSS to make it clean, centered, and responsive. I then used JavaScript to handle all the button interactions and perform the arithmetic operations. Each button updates the display dynamically, and I added logic for clearing, deleting, and toggling signs. I then included this project in my portfolio to showcase both my front-end design and programming skills.

### Challenges faced:
I had trouble with the toggle sign, if the button was pushed on the calculator it wouldn't update the value. After it was pushed and then another number was added or subtracted it would keep theh original number. But I was able to get it to work with a lot of trial and error. 

### Any additional features or improvements:
I implemented keyboard input support for improved accessibility.

### Acknowledegement of resources used:
If I was stuck on some things I did ask AI for a little help.
